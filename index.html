        <h2>Purpose and Context:</h2>
        <p>The React Native Chat App is a mobile application developed using React Native as part of my personal project to explore mobile app development. It serves as a showcase of my proficiency in building cross-platform mobile applications.</p>

        <h2>Objective:</h2>
        <p>The primary objective of the project was to demonstrate my ability to develop a comprehensive mobile application. I aimed to showcase my skills in both front-end and back-end development using React Native and Firebase.</p>

        <h2>Credits:</h2>
        <p>This project was undertaken solely by me as the project lead and developer. While I received guidance from online communities and tutorials, all aspects of development were handled independently.</p>

        <h2>Duration:</h2>
        <p>The project spanned over 2 months, during which I completed both client-side programming with React Native and backend setup with Firebase.</p>

            Step 1: Project Initiation
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose and Impact:</strong> Initiating the project laid the foundation for development, ensuring a structured environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Importance of this Step:</strong> It enabled smooth project setup and dependency management.</li>
            <li><strong>Technologies and Skills Employed:</strong> Utilized npm and Expo CLI for project setup and package management.</li>
            <li><strong>What went well:</strong> Efficient completion of server-side programming and successful setup of backend architecture.</li>
            <li><strong>Challenges and how I solved them:</strong> Addressed compatibility issues among dependencies by reviewing version requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Decision Process:</strong> Chose npm as the package manager to comply with industry standards.</li>
        </ul>

            Step 3: Frontend Development with React Native
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose and Impact:</strong> Setting up the frontend with React Native was essential for a dynamic and responsive user interface.</li>
            <li><strong>Importance of this Step:</strong> It contributed to creating a user-friendly interface and enhancing user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Technologies and Skills Employed:</strong> Utilized React Native and various libraries for frontend development.</li>
            <li><strong>What went well:</strong> Smooth frontend setup with efficient component rendering and state management.</li>
            <li><strong>Challenges and how I solved them:</strong> Addressed difficulties in integrating third-party libraries and managing state across components through debugging and testing. During development, I encountered an issue with Watchman that affected the Metro bundler. The error message indicated that Watchman was not running. I resolved this issue by restarting Watchman with the command `watchman shutdown-server` and granting the necessary permissions.</li>
            <li><strong>Decision Process:</strong> Chose React Native for frontend development due to its popularity and cross-platform capabilities.</li>
        </ul>
